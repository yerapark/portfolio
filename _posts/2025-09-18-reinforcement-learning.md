## Title
GNN-DQN:  Optimization of (Dynamic) Vehicle Routing for Waste Collection in Smart Cities



## Abstract
This study presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based framework to optimize waste vehicle routing in smart cities. The GNN processes graph-structured data to extract spatial features, while the DQN dynamically determines the optimal routes. The proposed model minimizes travel distances, avoids revisits, and reduces operational costs and carbon emissions. Experimental results show significant improvements, with travel distances reduced by 31% and rewards increasing steadily. This framework provides a scalable and intelligent solution for efficient waste collection, contributing to more sustainable urban waste management systems. Future work includes dynamic traffic integration and multi-vehicle optimization.
